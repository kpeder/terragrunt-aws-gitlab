## 2. All features include tests

Date: YYYY-MM-DD

### Status
Proposed

### Context
Features included in the product should be tested to ensure that functionality meets expectations and regressions are not introduced over time. This increases the quality of the product and provides a consistent benchmark for its expected operation.

This approach provides a foundation for the practice of Test Driven Development (TDD).

### Decision
New features must include functional tests.

### Consequences
1. All tests will need to pass before any Pull Request is merged.
1. Test updates will need to be included with all Pull Requests introducing new features.
